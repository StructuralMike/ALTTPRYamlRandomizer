# ALTTPRYamlRandomizer
Build Fun MultiWorld Yamls for you and your friends

This is meant to be used to modify your existing YAML settings for the Archipelago MultiWorld repo.

Every yaml in the /Player directory will be read, modified, and written to the /Output directory.

Modifications are done as per the settings defined in the YamlRandomizer.yaml file.


INSTRUCTIONS:
This tool relies a lot on the plando feature of Archipelago.
To enable this, you need to modify your Archipelago _host.yaml_ file accordingly:

    plando_options: "items,texts"
